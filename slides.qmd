## What if?

##

Ok, let's go make a web page.


## Javascript got better

Javascript has a lot of history, including... mistakes.

However, used tastefully, it is now quite a nice language.


## Modules

Packaging code used to be done in an ad-hoc way (UMD, etc).

One of the new things in Javascript is a proper module system (ESM).

**BUT** you need a web server to use ESM modules.

So:

* Javascript packages will often explain how to use their package the new way.
* At least initially, we'll use the old way.
