## What if?

## The big picture

We will be using:

*HTML* to create a web-page.

*SVG* to create pictures in the web-page.

*Javascript* to run code in the web-page.

*D3* a module that helps turn data into pictures.

Note you should also learn:

*styles* and *CSS* to format and lay out your web-page.


## HTML


##

Ok, let's go make a web page.


## SVG


## Javascript and D3





## Javascript got better

Javascript has a lot of history, including... mistakes.

* Complex rules for equality with `==`.

However, used tastefully, it is now quite a nice language.


## Modules

Packaging code used to be done in an ad-hoc way ("UMD", "AMD", "CJS").

One of the new things in Javascript is a proper module system (ESM).

**BUT** you need a web server to use ESM modules.

So:

* Javascript packages will often explain how to use their package the new way.
* At least initially, we'll use the old way.
