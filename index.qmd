## Examples

[D3 examples](https://observablehq.com/@d3/gallery) from [Observable](https://observablehq.com/).

[How to Use t-SNE Effectively](https://distill.pub/2016/misread-tsne/) in the brilliant [Distill Journal](https://distill.pub/), and a similar page on [UMAP](https://pair-code.github.io/understanding-umap/).

[Sleepwalk](https://anders-biostat.github.io/sleepwalk/) to examine true distances in an embedding like UMAP.

More bioinformatics examples: [Degust](https://degust.erc.monash.edu/degust/compare.html?code=example#/), [Glimma](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/Glimma/inst/doc/limma_edger.html), [igv.js](https://igv.org/web/release/3.0.8/examples/cram-vcf.html), [kana](https://www.kanaverse.org/kana/)


### Journalism

Amanda Cox has written many interactive articles. For example [this article](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/06/10/upshot/voting-habits-turnout-partisanship.html?searchResultPosition=9) features animations and reveals details where the mouse is pointing.

[The Pudding](https://pudding.cool/) features a similar style of article.


### My own examples

[Ghost Diagrams](https://logarithmic.net/ghost.xhtml), a tiling pattern app. I wrote this in 2006, it still works.

[Dance of the Confidence Intervals](https://logarithmic.net/2017/dance/) illustrates statistical concepts. This has been surprisingly useful for teaching!

[Langevitour article in the R Journal](https://doi.org/10.32614/RJ-2023-046) about a widget to tour your high-dimensional data.
