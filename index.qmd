## Examples

[D3 examples](https://observablehq.com/@d3/gallery) from [Observable](https://observablehq.com/).

[How to Use t-SNE Effectively](https://distill.pub/2016/misread-tsne/) in the [Distill Journal](https://distill.pub/), and a similar page on [UMAP](https://pair-code.github.io/understanding-umap/).

[Sleepwalk](https://anders-biostat.github.io/sleepwalk/) to examine true distances in an embedding like UMAP.

Amanda Cox applies data visualization as journalism. For example [this article](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/06/10/upshot/voting-habits-turnout-partisanship.html?searchResultPosition=9) features animations and reveals details where the mouse is pointing.


### My own examples

[Ghost Diagrams](https://logarithmic.net/ghost.xhtml), a tiling pattern app I wrote this in 2006. It still works.

[Dance of the Confidence Intervals](https://logarithmic.net/2017/dance/) illustrates statistical concepts. This has been surprisingly useful for teaching!

[Langevitour article in the R Journal](https://doi.org/10.32614/RJ-2023-046) about a widget to tour your high-dimensional data.
