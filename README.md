# HTML, Javascript, SVG, D3 - A foot in the door

This is a 1.5 hour workshop for [ResBaz Victoria 2024](https://resbaz.github.io/resbazvic2024/).

What if there was a way to let the whole world visualize and interact with your data, using code you have written, with video-game-like smoothness, and with software they already have on their laptop or phone? You can with a web page. Also you can do this for free and it will probably keep on working for decades to come.

This workshop will provide a first step writing the elements of a web page that can interactively present your data.

* Write a simple HTML page.
* Let it responds to the user with Javascript.
* Create pictures with SVG.
* Turn your data into pictures with D3.
* Debug your page using your browser's web-developer tools.
* Publish your page on the web.

**Pre-requisites:** Some experience with another programming language will be helpful, such as Python or R.
